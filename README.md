My name is Andre Ellis Junior.

Welcome to my progress as a web developer.

I have been studying on my own for a little over a year now and I pursue to learn on a regular basis.

Take a look at what I have in the moment.

I am always open to suggestions and ready to implement improvement ideas and concepts.
